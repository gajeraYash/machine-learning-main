# Machine Learning Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Portfolio**, where I showcase various ML projects using Traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each category has its own dedicated repository.

1) **Stock Price Prediction** ðŸ“ˆ  
   - **Description**: Predicts future stock prices using **Linear Regression** with `PyTorch`.  
   - **Features**:  
     âœ… Fetches real stock data from **Yahoo Finance**  
     âœ… Uses **Min-Max Scaling** for normalization  
     âœ… Implements **Linear Regression in PyTorch**  
     âœ… Saves & loads trained models for future predictions  
     âœ… Plots **actual vs. predicted stock prices**
